## Elevator Pitch

This project is **for** the cafe business **who** want the opportunity to collect and analyse data from customers in order to grow their business. **The** ETL / Visualisation software **is a** pipeline and analysis product **that** will collate data to a central location and transform the data for future analysis. It will keep up with the high data volume and schema fluctuations, **unlike** the current system which uses single branch generated CSV's which cannot be collated or stored centrally for further analysis, **our product** will help their business continue their growth through identifying company wide trends and responding as such.
